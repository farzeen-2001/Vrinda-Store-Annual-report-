This is my first project and I've created a interactive Dashboard of Vrinda Store Annual report for 2022. The owner of the store wants to gain an insights about the annual performance to optimize their business and increase efficiency
The dashboard highlights:
~Total Sales: Annual revenue of Rs 2,11,76,377
~Sales Trends: month_wise sales and order trends
~Channel performance: comparative analysis of sales across different platforms 
~Demographics: Breakdown of sales by age, Gender

Process:
Data cleaning: verify the data to check for any missing or null values using filters , made sure the data is consistent according to the format and data type
creation of pivot tables: created pivot tables according the KPI requirements and applied slicer for months,channels to make dynamic and interactive dashboard
